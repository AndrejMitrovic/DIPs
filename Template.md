## Abstract

Short description of the idea fitting into few lines.

### Links

Optional sections containing links to existing discussions, research papers or any
other supplemental materials.

## Description

Detailed technical description of new semantics / changes.

### Rationale

Explanation of why the proposed change is important and worth being
implemented. Referencing existing projects and showing how their issues can be
solved by the proposal greatly increases chance of DIP being understood and
carefully evaluated.

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

Detailed analysis on how proposed changes may affect existing user code and
step-by-step explanation of deprecation process which is supposed to handle
that in non-intrusive manner. Changes that may break user code and have no
well-defined deprecation process have a minimal chance of being approved.

### Examples

More practical explanation of DIP semantics using several examples of its
idiomatic application. It is usually much easier to quick evaluate value
of the proposal by looking at how it affects non-synthetic code than by try
to reason about abstract description.
